# Project_2
For Project 2, you will work with your group to solve, analyze, or visualize a problem using machine learning (ML), along with the other technologies you’ve learned so far. Here are the specific requirements:

Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.
The dataset(s) for your project must have at least 500 records. (If developing a decision tree/random forest model, you should use at least 1,000 records.)
Use either a supervised or unsupervised ML model to solve, analyze, or visualize the problem.
Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.
You must use Scikit-learn.
You must use at least three of the following:
API requests
Matplotlib
Pandas
Pandas plotting
Prophet
Python
Time series analysis
For this project, you can focus your efforts within a specific industry, as detailed in the following examples.

Finance
Create an algorithm that analyzes credit scores and predicts consumer personal-loan eligibility.

Using natural language processing, create a chatbot to perform simple tasks and help users find information.

Train an algorithm to analyze consumer spending and predict trends.

Train an image classifier to assess property value, which could then be used to calculate insurance quotes.

Healthcare
Train an algorithm to recognize disease symptoms and predict if a patient is at risk.

Train an image classifier to recognize anomalies, such as suspicious vs healthy areas of skin.

Using natural language processing, create a chatbot that will help connect patients with doctors.

Create an algorithm to analyze patient history and predict the likelihood of inherited illness.

Custom
We’ve only specified healthcare and finance, but any industry can benefit from machine learning. Consider preparing a data deep dive or infrastructure review that shows machine learning in the context of what we’ve already learned.

Create a front-end interface that maps to an API to “smarten” the algorithm.

Perform a deep dive on existing data using machine learning.

Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based on ML (use Leaflet or Plotly to change the visualization).

Create an idea using mock data, and simulate how machine learning might be used.

Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.

Working with Your Group
When working on an online group project, it’s crucial to meet with your group and communicate regularly. Plan for significant collaboration time outside of class. The following tips can help you make the most of your time:

Decide how you’re going to communicate with your group members when you begin. Create a Slack channel, exchange phone numbers, and ensure that the group knows each group member’s available working hours.

Set up an agile project by using GitHub ProjectsLinks to an external site. so that your group can track tasks.

Create internal milestones to ensure that your group is on track. Set due dates for these milestones so that you have a timeline for completing the project. Some of these milestones might include:

Project ideation;

Data fetching;

Data exploration;

Data transformation;

Data analysis;

Testing;

Creating documentation; and

Creating the presentation.

Since this is a two-week project, make sure that you have completed at least half of your project by the end of the first week in order to stay on track.

Although you will divide the work among the group members, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your teammates regularly and offer support.

Support and Resources
Your instructional team will provide support during classes and office hours. You will also have access to learning assistants and tutors to help you with topics as needed. Make sure to take advantage of these resources as you collaborate with your group on this project.

Requirements
